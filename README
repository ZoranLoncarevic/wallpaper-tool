This is supposed to be a script for doing everything related
to desktop wallpaper. It is inspired by

https://www.reddit.com/r/
unixporn/comments/7iddwn/i3lock_faster_and_better_lockscreen/.

Command line syntax is

     wallpaper command [ commad arguments and options... ]

Commands encompass setting wallpaper (set), getting filename
of current wallpaper (getfilename), cycling thru wallpapers
in single directory, browsing thru wallpapers and applying
filters like blur, dimming, tinting, etc... (see below).
Vague future plans include automatic downloading of
wallpapers from specialized sites, extensive logging,
undo of all operations.

RIGHT NOW, I concentrate on set command with syntax

     wallpaper set (filename|DEFAULT|CLIP)
                   [ (dim|blur|tint) [opt_arg] ...]

Special targets DEFAULT and CLIP are replaced with the built
in default wallpaper filename and content of clipboard,
respectively. Sets wallpaper to an image contained in
filename applying to it beforehand image filters specified
in optional

     image_recipe := ( filter_op [op_operand] ... )

If set command and filename is ommited, leaving only image
recipe, filters are applied to the current wallpaper image,
expanding command line effectively to

     wallpaper set $(wallpaper getfilename) image_recipe

Image filters are applied one by one, in the order specified
on the command line, with final modified image and all
intermediate results being stored in subdirectory .wall-cache
created in the same directory as the original image.
(I don't think this is the ideal place for cache; see
Q1 below for futher discussion.)
